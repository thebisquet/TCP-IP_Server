		<h1>Keinen Bousquet</h1>
		<br><p>Since 1994, I have been alive and well. I started off from humble beginnings
			and have been working my way up the ladder of success ever since. Graduating High
			School and joining the Marine Corps at the age of 17, I was never one to back
			away from a challenge. reaching the end of my first contract I decided it would
			be best for my family to leave the Corps and move back up north away from the
			crazies. Since then, I have been attending Dakota State University to obtain a
			bachelors degree in computer science.</p><br>
		<div><p>Hopefully, one day, I will do something worth while and something that makes
			a long lasting impact on the well-being of those around me. That's a tall order though.</p></div>
